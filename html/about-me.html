        <ol>
            <li>Online Gaming</li>
                <p>
                I've been playing game online since I was about 10 years old or so, it started with playing Halo 2 on my uncles Xbox. <br>
                Since then I've been hooked. I mainly play First-Person Shooters, but I also enjoy playing MMORPG's such as World of Warcraft <br>
                and Final Fantasy XIV
                </p>
            <li>Weight Lifting</li>
                <p>
                    I wake up Tuesday-Saturday at 5:00 in the morning to go work out. I enjoy pushing myself in the weight room to become better.
                </p>
            <li>Sports</li>
                <p>
